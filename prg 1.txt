<?php
$capital=67;
print("Variable capital is $capital");
print("Variable CaPiTaL is $CaPiTaL");
?>
Explanation:

$capital is defined, $CaPiTaL is not.

PHP variable names are case-sensitive, so $CaPiTaL is different from $capital.

Unset variables return an empty string (and throw a notice).
